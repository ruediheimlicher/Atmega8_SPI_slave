    MCU:   ATMega128/ATMega103
    Internal osc:  1 MHz
    Operating frequency:  1 MHz
    UART Speed:     57600 kbit
    Connection:
      MicroVGA.TXD = ATMega128.RCD0 (RXD)
      MicroVGA.RXD = ATMega128.TXD0 (TXD)
      MicroVGA.CTS = ATMega128.PB7 (GPIO configuration)
	
	Defines are used to provide code compatibility between one UART and 
	two UART atmel devices.

   _putch, _getch, _kbhit must be defined for lib (conio.c and ui.c)
